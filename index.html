      <div>
	<p>I have been participating in first robotics competitions for over a decade, including four years of high school level robotics. I have been primarily the lead programer but have also gotten experience in mechanical engineering, electrical engineering, fabrication, and business/logistics.</p>
	<p>I wrote <b>Computer Vision</b> applications for FRC and the sparkfun AVC using <b>OpenCV</b>. I have written code for identifying a variety of targets including red balloons, squares of reflective tape, and yellow totes. I have also used CUDA hardware acceleration on a Jetson TK-1. I have written several articles about these including two articles about <a href="http://pleasingsoftware.blogspot.com/2014/06/hardware-accelerated-opencv.html">configuring the jetson board</a> and <a href="http://pleasingsoftware.blogspot.com/2014/06/identifying-balloons-using-computer.html">tracking balloons.</a></p>
	<p>I <b>embedded Lua</b> on a C++ base for my FRC Team to use during the 2015 season. I created a custom API wrapping for Lua to the robot hardware libraries.</p>
