      <h2>Employment History</h2>
      <div>
	<h3>Virginia Tech Transportation Institute</h3>
	<p>I worked on research and development of an app for Android to detect potholes in roads based on IMU data. After researching pothole detection algorithms in the current literature, I was part of a team of two that implemented and tested those algorithms. Using our mathematical background, we then implemented and tested our own ideas. The app was written in Java.</p>
	<h3>Oildex</h3>
	<p>I helped develop a webapp for managing payments and logistics. I worked on a small team and performed a wide variety of duties including automation, UI, frontend, and backend work. I used javascript, HTML, and Scala.</p>
	<h3>Neaera Consulting</h3>
	<p>I worked on developing a GIS app for Windows 8 and Windows Phone. I was in charge of writing a data abstraction and rendering layer suitable for offline mapping. I wrote in C# and XAML.</p>
	<h3>Virginia Tech Transportation Institute</h3>
	<p>I was a developer maintaining and enhancing a web application for collecting and viewing research data. I worked on both frontend and backend development in Groovy and HTML.</p>

      <h2>Experience</h2>
      <div>
	<p>I have been participating in first robotics competitions for over a decade, including four years of high school level robotics. I have been primarily the lead programer but have also gotten experience in mechanical engineering, electrical engineering, fabrication, and business/logistics.</p>
	<p>I wrote <b>Computer Vision</b> applications for FRC and the sparkfun AVC using <b>OpenCV</b>. I have written code for identifying a variety of targets including red balloons, squares of reflective tape, and yellow totes. I have also used CUDA hardware acceleration on a Jetson TK-1. I have written several articles about these including two articles about <a href="http://pleasingsoftware.blogspot.com/2014/06/hardware-accelerated-opencv.html">configuring the jetson board</a> and <a href="http://pleasingsoftware.blogspot.com/2014/06/identifying-balloons-using-computer.html">tracking balloons.</a></p>
	<p>I <b>embedded Lua</b> on a C++ base for my FRC Team to use during the 2015 season. I created a custom API wrapping for Lua to the robot hardware libraries.</p>
