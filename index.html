			<p>Founder, Owner, developer writing front end, backend, and system code in various languages. The project is a distributed programming game suitable for use in educational and research contexts. Skills include realtime data analytics, security, compiler internals and sandboxing, and scalability.</p>
			<h3>Microsoft &mdash; <span>Summer 2017</span></h3>
			<p>Software Development Intern writing C# for the Common Data Service. I was an independent developer running the project to create an integration layer between CDS and the Azure Search Service allowing querying on databases with millions of records and shared tenancy for smaller stores. This service is intended to form an internal layer to build consumer facing interfaces.</p>
			<h3>Virginia Tech Transportation Institute &mdash; <span>Spring 2017</span></h3>
			<p>Development and creation of core algorithms for a GIS app tracking traffic redirection around roadwork.</p>
			<h3>Virginia Tech Transportation Institute &mdash; <span>Summer 2016</span></h3>
			<p>Research and development of an app for Android to detect potholes in roads based on IMU data. After researching pothole detection algorithms in the current literature, I was part of a team of two that implemented and tested those algorithms. Using our mathematical background, we then implemented and tested our own ideas. The app was written in Java.</p>
			<h3>Oildex &mdash; <span>Summer 2015</span></h3>
			<p>Webapp development for managing payments and logistics. I worked on a small team and performed a wide variety of duties including automation, UI, front-end, and back-end work. I used javascript, HTML, and Scala.</p>

		<h2>Experience</h2>
		<div>
			<p>I made significant contributions to the core <a href="https://terralang.org/">Terra</a> syntax and am one of the members in charge of designing and implementing the standard library.</p>
			<p>I have written <a href="https://github.com/aiverson/luaExtensions">extensions</a> to the Lua compiler and interpreter. I implemented spread access and safe access operators inspired by Groovy.</p>
			<p>I wrote <b>Computer Vision</b> applications for FRC and the sparkfun AVC using <b>OpenCV</b>. I have written code for identifying a variety of targets including red balloons, squares of reflective tape, and yellow totes. I have also used CUDA hardware acceleration on a Jetson TK-1. I have written several articles about these including two articles about <a href="http://pleasingsoftware.blogspot.com/2014/06/hardware-accelerated-opencv.html">configuring the Jetson board</a> and <a href="http://pleasingsoftware.blogspot.com/2014/06/identifying-balloons-using-computer.html">tracking balloons.</a></p>
			<p>I have been participating in first robotics competitions for over a decade, including four years of high school level robotics, qualifying for the world championships six times. I have been primarily the lead programmer but have also gotten experience in mechanical engineering, electrical engineering, fabrication, and business/logistics.</p>
			<p>I <b>embedded Lua</b> on a C++ base for my FRC Team to use during the 2015 season. I created a custom API wrapping for Lua to the robot hardware libraries.</p>
			<p>I wrote <a href="https://github.com/aiverson/frlua">FRLua</a>, a library to bring functional reactive constructs to lua.</p>
